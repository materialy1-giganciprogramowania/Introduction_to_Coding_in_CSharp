# Secret Message Challenge (GitHub)

This is a mini-task for a lesson about GitHub (browser-only) and careful analysis of changes.

## Task for the student
1. Open the file `dziennik.txt` on GitHub.
2. Click **History** (file history).
3. Open each commit and examine the **diff** (what has changed).
4. In each commit, you will find **one added word** at the end of a line starting with `WSKAZÓWKA:`.
5. Write down the added words in the order of the commits and combine them to reveal the hidden message.

## Bonus
- Take a screenshot or make notes showing which word appeared in which commit.
- Try to find a change that looks like a “regular fix” but is actually a clue.
